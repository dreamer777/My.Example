This repo is an example for using DTO.tt. It contains My.Common repo as submodule, so DTO.tt is referenced in IncludeDTO.tt by the include directive.

Project My.Example.DAL contains DTO description and Db class. Autogenerated classes are already generated.

Main project is My.Example.Web. It is a simple website with only one goal to simply maintain users. It contains only five pages - login page, users list, create user, view user, users activity page. DAL has three DTO classes - it is just a demo project for tt-generator.

Page Users.aspx illustrates statistics filters concept.
